If one type of functionality that was repeatedly developed (“web
interface”) is excluded, the overlap is even lower (see table 2.2). Other
responses by study participants add to this impression of high heterogene-
ity of need among users. Thirty percent of the respondents reported that
their library IT system had been highly customized by the manufacturer
during installation to meet their specific needs. In addition, 54 percent of
study respondents agreed with the statement “We would like to make addi-
tional improvements to our IT system functionality that can’t be made by
simply adjusting the standard, customer-accessible parameters provided
by the supplier.”
Similar moderate overlap in the characteristics of user innovations can be
seen in innovation descriptions provided in the study of mountain biking
by Lüthje, Herstatt, and von Hippel (2002). In that study sample, I estimate
that at most 10 of 43 innovations had functionality similar to that of
another sample member.
